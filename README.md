# ❤️ HEART AI – Personal AI Assistant

> A modular, voice-powered personal AI assistant that combines conversational AI, persistent memory, voice authentication, and desktop automation to help users interact naturally with their computer.

---

## Overview

HEART AI is a Python-based personal AI assistant designed to act as an intelligent desktop companion rather than a simple chatbot. It understands natural language, performs real-world tasks, automates Windows operations, remembers previous conversations, and securely interacts with the user through voice authentication.

The project focuses on creating an AI assistant capable of assisting with daily productivity, system management, communication, and intelligent automation while maintaining a modular and extensible architecture.
